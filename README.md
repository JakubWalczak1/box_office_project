# box_office_project
The aim of this project is to create machine learning models for predicting box office revenue. The project begins with web scraping utilizing BeautifulSoup to gather relevant data from wikipedia.org and rottentomatoes.com. Subsequently, a thorough process of data cleansing is undertaken to prepare the dataset for analysis. The dataset is subjected to extensive data exploration with multiple charts and statistics. After this part and some data engineering 3 distinct types of regression models are developed: random forest, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and neural network. Each model undergoes training and evaluation using appropriate regression metrics to gauge its effectiveness in predicting box office revenue.

The outcomes of this project hold considerable potential for application in the film industry, market research, and investment decision-making. Accurate predictive models for forecasting box office revenue can offer valuable insights for film studios, distributors, and investors, aiding in strategic planning, budget allocation, and performance assessment of movie releases.
