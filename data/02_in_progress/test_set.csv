In present day, a decade after the last of the Cabrini towers were torn down, visual artist Anthony McCoy (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II; HBO's Watchmen, Us) and his partner, gallery director Brianna Cartwright (Teyonah Parris; If Beale Street Could Talk, The Photograph), move into a luxury loft condo in Cabrini, now gentrified beyond recognition and inhabited by upwardly mobile millennials. With Anthony's painting career on the brink of stalling, a chance encounter with a Cabrini-Green old-timer (Colman Domingo; HBO's Euphoria, Assassination Nation) exposes Anthony to the tragically horrific nature of the true story behind Candyman. Anxious to maintain his status in the Chicago art world, Anthony begins to explore these macabre details in his studio as fresh grist for paintings, unknowingly opening a door to a complex past that unravels his own sanity and unleashes a terrifying wave of violence that puts him on a collision course with destiny.",Scope (2.35:1),,,,,,,"<p><i><b>Candyman</b></i> is a 2021 <a href=""/wiki/Supernatural_horror_film"" title=""Supernatural horror film"">supernatural horror film</a> directed by <a href=""/wiki/Nia_DaCosta"" title=""Nia DaCosta"">Nia DaCosta</a> and written by <a href=""/wiki/Jordan_Peele"" title=""Jordan Peele"">Jordan Peele</a>, <a href=""/wiki/Win_Rosenfeld"" title=""Win Rosenfeld"">Win Rosenfeld</a>, and DaCosta.

After a mysterious space-race era satellite coincidentally falls from space and lands in his backyard, his midlife crisis manifests in a plan to rebuild the machine into his dream rocket. As his relationship with his wife (Rhea Seehorn) and daughter (Katelyn Nacon) start to strain, surreal events begin unfolding around him -- a doppelgänger moving into the house next door, a car falling from the sky, and an unusual teenage boy forging a friendship with him. He slowly starts to piece these events together to ultimately reveal that there's more to his life story than he once thought.",,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/Linoleum,,,,,/m/linoleum_2022,"<p><i><b>Linoleum</b></i> is a 2022 American <a href=""/wiki/Science_fiction_film"" title=""Science fiction film"">science fiction</a> <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Comedy-drama"" title=""Comedy-drama"">comedy-drama</a> film written and directed by Colin West and starring <a href=""/wiki/Jim_Gaffigan"" title=""Jim Gaffigan"">Jim Gaffigan</a>.

Based on actual events, the film unravels long-held assumptions about France's last sanctioned duel between Jean de Carrouges and Jacques Le Gris, two friends turned bitter rivals. Carrouges is a respected knight known for his bravery and skill on the battlefield. Le Gris is a Norman squire whose intelligence and eloquence make him one of the most admired nobles in court. When Carrouges' wife, Marguerite, is viciously assaulted by Le Gris, a charge he denies, she refuses to stay silent, stepping forward to accuse her attacker, an act of bravery and defiance that puts her life in jeopardy. The ensuing trial by combat, a grueling duel to the death, places the fate of all three in God's hands.",Scope (2.35:1),,,,,,,"<p><i><b>The Last Duel</b></i> is a 2021 <a href=""/wiki/Epic_film"" title=""Epic film"">epic</a>

For the first time in more than a decade, DreamWorks Animation presents a new adventure in the Shrek universe as daring outlaw Puss in Boots discovers that his passion for peril and disregard for safety have taken their toll. Puss has burned through eight of his nine lives, though he lost count along the way. Getting those lives back will send Puss in Boots on his grandest quest yet. Academy Award® nominee Antonio Banderas returns as the voice of the notorious PiB as he embarks on an epic journey into the Black Forest to find the mythical Wishing Star and restore his lost lives. But with only one life left, Puss will have to humble himself and ask for help from his former partner and nemesis: the captivating Kitty Soft Paws (Oscar® nominee Salma Hayek). In their quest, Puss and Kitty will be aided--against their better judgment--by a ratty, chatty, relentlessly cheerful mutt, Perro (Harvey Guillén, What We Do in the Shadows). Together, our trio of heroes will have to stay one step ahead of Goldilocks (Oscar® nominee Florence Pugh, Black Widow) and the Three Bears Crime Family, ""Big"" Jack Horner (Emmy winner John Mulaney, Big Mouth) and terrifying bounty hunter, The Big Bad Wolf (Wagner Moura, Narcos).",Digital 2.39:1,,,,,,,"<p><i><b>Puss in Boots: The Last Wish</b></i> is a 2022 American animated <a href=""/wiki/Adventure_film"" title=""Adventure film"">adventure</a> comedy film produced by <a href=""/wiki/DreamWorks_Animation"" title=""DreamWorks Animation"">DreamWorks Animation</a> and distributed by <a href=""/wiki/Universal_Pictures"" title=""Universal Pictures"">Universal Pictures</a>.
